# Discrete clock-like counter, initialized from the system clock.
# It produces monotonically increasing timestamps for user-generated channel elements.
# Note that we only use the system clock to initialize the counter
# when starting Tribler. Afterwards, we increase the counter ourselves. This supposes
# that users do not create more than a 1000 entries per second and their clock does
# not go backwards between Tribler restarts.
