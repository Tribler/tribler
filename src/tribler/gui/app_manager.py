    A helper class that calls QApplication.quit().

    You should never call `QApplication.quit()` directly. Call `app_manager.quit_application()` instead.
    It is necessary to avoid runtime errors like "wrapped C/C++ object of type ... has been deleted".

    After `app_manager.quit_application()` was called, it is not safe to access Qt objects anymore.
    If a signal can be emitted during the application shutdown, you can check `app_manager.quitting_app` flag
    inside the signal handler to be sure that it is still safe to access Qt objects.
