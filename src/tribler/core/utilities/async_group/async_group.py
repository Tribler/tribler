    # This set added to prevent the potential issue described here https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/issues/7299
    # A corner case here is the following (@kozlovsky):
    #
    # It is possible that an async group itself is garbage-collected before all its tasks are finished.
    # In that case, tasks managed by this async group can be garbage collected before they are finished.
    #
    # Usually, it should not be a problem, as an async group is typically created as a field of another object
    # with a long life span. So, someone holds a reference to AsyncGroup long enough to prevent its early garbage
    # collection.
    # But theoretically, some async groups can be garbage collected too early.
    #
    # To prevent this problem all futures stores in the global set.
