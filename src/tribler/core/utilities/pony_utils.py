    You should use `run_threaded` to wrap all functions that should be executed from a separate thread and work with
    the database. The `run_threaded` function ensures that all database connections opened in worker threads are
    properly closed before the Tribler shutdown.

    The Asyncio `run_in_executor` method executes its argument in a separate worker thread. After the db_session is
    over, PonyORM caches the connection to the database to re-use it again later in the same thread. It was previously
    reported that some obscure problems could be observed during the Tribler shutdown if connections in the Tribler
    worker threads are not closed properly.
