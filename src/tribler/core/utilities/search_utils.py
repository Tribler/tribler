    This is a helper function to efficiently answer a question of how close a query string and a title string are,

    of the found word and rotating all leading non-matching words to the end of the deque. It allows to efficiently
    perform multiple calls of the `find_word_and_rotate_title` function for subsequent words from the same query string.

    An example: find_word_and_rotate_title('A', deque(['X', 'Y', 'A', 'B', 'C'])) returns `(True, 2)`, where True means
    that the word 'A' was found in the `title` deque, and 2 is the number of skipped words ('X', 'Y'). Also, it modifies
    the `title` deque, so it starts looking like deque(['B', 'C', 'X', 'Y']). The found word 'A' was removed, and
    the leading non-matching words ('X', 'Y') were moved to the end of the deque.
