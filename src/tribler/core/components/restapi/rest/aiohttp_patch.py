    # This function monkey-patches a bug in the aiohttp library, see #7344 and aio-libs/aiohttp#7258.
    # The essence of the bug is that the `aiohttp.web_protocol.RequestHandler.start()` coroutine erroneously continues
    # to run after a connection was closed from the client side, the transport was closed, and None was assigned
    # to `self.transport`. Then the `start` coroutine calls `self._make_request(...)`, which in turn creates
    # an `aiohttp.web_request.Request` instance, and it has `assert transport is not None` in its constructor.
    #
    # To fix the bug, the monkey-patched `_make_request` method first checks if the `self.transport is None`, and if so,
    # it raises the `CancelledError` exception to cancel the erroneously working `RequestHandler.start` coroutine.
    #
    # Additionally, the new `_make_request` method increases the counter of cases when the transport was None
    # to allow gathering some statistics on how often this situation happens
