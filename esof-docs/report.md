# Tribler - 1st Report

###Introduction

We are four students, attending "Software Engineering", a subject from the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering from University of Porto, currently analysing this open source project.
_Tribler_ is a Peer-to-Peer file sharing program that uses a dedicated Tor-like network for anonymous torrent downloading. The aim of this project is giving anonymous access to online (streaming) videos, trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.
