# ESOF Tribler

###Introduction

We are four students, attending "Software Engineering", a subject from the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering from University of Porto, currently analysing this Open Source project _Tribler_.


One of the first checkpoints it's to answer some questions about this project: 

****

**_How is the project management done?_**


**_Which Software development Process do you use? And why did you choose it?_**
