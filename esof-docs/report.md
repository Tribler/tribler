# Tribler - 1st Report

###Introduction

We are four students, attending "Software Engineering", a subject from the Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering from University of Porto, currently analysing this open source project.
_Tribler_ is a **Peer-to-Peer file sharing program** that uses a dedicated **Tor-like network** for anonymous torrent downloading. The aim of this project is giving anonymous access to online (streaming) videos, trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.

###Development process

As of today (03/10/2015), we weren't able to get a reply from the main contributors regarding the development process used in this project. Based on the existing processes and the project at hand, we chose what was, in our opinion, the most adequate development process for this specific project, the **incremental development and delivery**.
The basic idea behind this method is to develop a system through repeated cycles (iterative) and in smaller portions at a time (incremental), allowing software developers to take advantage of what was learned during development of earlier parts or versions of the system, what makes this method great for the development of an open source project with a large number of contributors like _Tribler_.
