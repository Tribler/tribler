This script provides a sterile way of generating headless tribler daemon using containers.

The container is based on manylinux1 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/#the-manylinux1-policy) abi compatability to satisfy broadrange of linux distrubtion systems.

Only dependecy generated by the executable is glibc v2.5 and zlin. zlib is alreay bundled in the executable. The complier used in he container is gcc 4.8.2.

 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared Library: [libdl.so.2]
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared Library: [libz.so.1] (Bundled in the executable)
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)                     Shared Library: [libc.so.6]

 
The basis for the container can be found at (https://github.com/hbiyik/shared-manylinux1) which is a fork of original manylinux1 repo with python to be compiled shared libraries enabled.

To use the script you need docker installed inn your system. Then simply run the script.
