tribler (6.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Faster downloads: We have switched from the old python based bittorrent core to Rasterbar's libtorrent, so expect less resource usage too, we are saturating a symmetric 100Mb/s connection without much trouble.
  * Less disk and CPU consumption used for community synchronization.
  * UI improvements (download speed graphs, some new icons, general UI cleanup...)
  * Throttling (Bandwidth limitation) is working again.
  * The LibSwift engine has been updated too.
  * The "Save as" dialog has been modified to improve usability when downloading from magnet links.
  * Thumbnails for downloaded media: Now when a new video file gets downloaded, Tribler will automatically create a thumbnail and make it available to the rest of peers to be shown on the search results.
  * Fixed freezing at startup on some machines.
  * Fixed race conditions and lockups in synchronizations.
  * Various bug fixes and minor improvements.
  * Fixes for the bugs reported by the community during beta1 and beta2 (Thanks!)
