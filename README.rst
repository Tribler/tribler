*Towards making Bittorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.*

We use our own dedicated Tor-like network for anonymous torrent downloading.
We implemented and enhanced the `Tor protocol specifications <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications>`_.
Tribler includes our own Tor-like onion routing network with hidden services based
seeding and `end-to-end encryption <https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications>`_.

Tribler aims to give anonymous access to content. We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography, and authentication the Internet norm.

For the past 11 years we have been building a very robust Peer-to-Peer system.
Today Tribler is robust: "the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down" (but a single software bug could end everything).

Running Tribler from the repository
###################################

We support development on Linux, macOS and Windows. We have written
documentation that guides you through installing the required packages when
setting up a Tribler development environment.

* `Linux <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/development_on_linux.html>`_
* `Windows <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/development_on_windows.html>`_
* `macOS <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/development_on_osx.html>`_



Packaging Tribler
=================

We have written guides on how to package Tribler for distribution on various systems.

* `Linux <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/building.html>`_
* `Windows <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/building_on_windows.html>`_
* `macOS <http://tribler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building/building_on_osx.html>`_


Docker support
=================

Dockerfile is provided with the source code which can be used to build the docker image.

To build the docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker build -t triblercore/triblercore:latest .


To run the built docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -p 20100:20100 --net="host" triblercore/triblercore:latest

Note that by default, the REST API is bound to localhost inside the container so to
access the APIs, network needs to be set to host (--net="host").

The REST APIs are now accessible at: http://localhost:20100/docs


**Docker Compose**

Tribler core can also be started using Docker Compose. For that, a `docker-compose.yml` file is available
on the project root directory.

To run via docker compose:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up


To run in detached mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose up -d


To stop Tribler:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose down
