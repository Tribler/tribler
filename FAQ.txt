Do you support Linux?

Yes, we do. You do need to install some additional software. Check out the Tribler readme.txt in the source code available from our SourceForge page.

Alternatively, you can try our experimental (!) Debian package, by adding a Debian "testing" repository and our Debian repository to your package-management client:
http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian testing main
http://debian.tribler.org/debian testing main
and then select "tribler" for install.
Do you support MacOS X? 09

Yes, as of 3.4.0 we also provide a Mac installer. You should also be able to build it yourself on MacOS using these instructions.
Where's live streaming?

Live streaming (bleeding edge) is available for download!
Is there a forum?

Yes, checkout our SourceForge page.
Do I need to configure my NAT/firewall? and other network issues 09

Hopefully not. We support UPnP to open a listening port on your firewall (6881) automatically. UPnP "mode 3" is on by default as of 3.6.0. If this mode doesn't work for you and you're on Windows, you can try selecting a different mode, using the "Preferences / Network / Advanced" menu. Try "Mode 1" first. If your OS/NAT doesn't support UPnP you may have to open the port by hand. This is necessary to use the download booster and recommendation features of Tribler. More importantly, it will speed up your downloads as peers can now also connect to you instead of just you connecting to them.

When you're defining friends and sending the information from the "My Info" window to your friends (see below), make sure you replace the IP address shown there with your actual external IP address. Tribler cannot detect this external address. If the address in the window starts with 192.168. you need to replace it (consult your ISP's documentation).

You can change the address that shows up in "My info" by setting the "Preferences / Network / Advanced / IP to bind to" field. Note that if you have more than one network interface, setting this field will make your client inaccessible from clients on the other network interfaces.

Tribler currently has only limited support for hosts that change addresses frequently. Recommendation will work less efficiently, and you will have to explicitly connect to your friends by requesting their help in a cooperative download to update their databases. Otherwise, cooperative downloads will probably not work. See below.
Legal P2P, does that exist? 09

Yes, and it is rapidly picking up speed. The Internet Archive has big plans for distributing their content via BitTorrent. And Tribler will be cooperating with the Dutch public broadcasters to make content available via peer-to-peer. Now Tribler already hosts the world's first Open Movie: "Elephants Dream" produced entirely with open-source tools and released under a Creative Commons License.

You can try the following samples from the Internet Archive that we seed:

    * Sailor meets Ali Baba's thieves (1937)
    * Popeye the Sailor with Li'l Swee' Pea (1936)
    * Betty Boo and the Musical Mountaineers
    * Tom and Jerry - The Rocketeers
    * Superman (1941)
    * Superman in "Billion Dollar Limited" (1942)
    * Gulliver's Travels (1939)
    * Alfred Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much" (1934)
    * Ernest Hemingway's "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) 

You should also check sites like

    * www.vuze.com distributes movie trailers in HD via BitTorrent
    * www.publicdomaintorrents.com
    * www.legaltorrents.com 

And a lot of free software is being distributed via BitTorrent, for example, the OpenOffice office suite.
Privacy

From our license: [Tribler] will by default exchange your download history with others. This feature can be disabled by disabling the recommender in the Preference menu. See also the disclaimer at [the bottom of this page]
Where do recommendations come from?

Recommendations are made using a collaborative filtering algorithm. This algorithm will compare your download history to that of the peers you meet. If the peer has torrents in its download history that you have not downloaded it will recommend them to you. The recommendation value assigned to the torrent and shown in the Recommendation window depends on how similar the peer's download history is to yours. So the higher the value, the more you are predicted to like it.
How do I use the Download Booster / Cooperative download feature? 09

To use the download booster, you first need to define who your friends are, and your friends will have to add you as their friend. To do so, send the information from the "My Info" window in the "File" menu to your friends. On Windows, you can use the "Invitation" button in the "My Info" window to send an email automatically.

Next, open a torrent's detail window and look for the "Download booster" tab which should be self explanatory. After sending the help requests, the contacted friends should show up in the list of peers (check the "PermID" column at the end). For a complex technical reason, they may not show up there, in which case you could locate them by their IP address. (The complex technical reason is that we use two TCP connection between download helpers. One authenticated connection for control traffic and an unauthenicated connection for data. As the list of peers in the detail window shows data connections, we can only make a guess at the actual identity of the peer, hence it doesn't always work. The integrity of the data from the data connection is, of course, verified as in normal BitTorrent.)
Tribler won't start again

Unfortunately, you have stumbled upon a bug. To get things working again, you should delete some files from the directory:

C:\Documents and Settings\User\Application Data\.Tribler

where "User" should be replaced by your own user name (for version 3.3.x replace .Tribler with .ABC). To locate this directory, you may have to enable "Show hidden files and folders" in the "Tools / Folder Options / View" menu of the Windows explorer. On Linux the directory is $HOME/.Tribler. From this directory, delete:

    * bsddb directory
    * Everything starting with torrent
    * Everything ending in cache 

I don't get my normal 20 KB/s download speed

The recommendation feature of Tribler will exchange torrents with other Tribler clients. As most people are not yet using Merkle torrents this may consume a considerable amount of bandwidth. If you have a small connection, you could disable the torrent collecting part of the recommendation feature via the "Preferences / Tribler" menu. In that case, you will see the recommendations made, but won't be able to download the content directly. You'll need to look elsewhere for the torrent if you see something you like.
