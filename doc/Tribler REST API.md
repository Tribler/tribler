# Tribler REST API

## Overview
The Tribler REST API allows you to create your own applications with the channels, torrents and other data that can be found in Tribler. Moreover, you can control Tribler and add data to Tribler using various endpoints. This documentation explains the format and structure of the endpoints that can be found in this API. *Note that this API is currently under development and more endpoints will be added over time*.

## Making requests
The API has been built using [Twisted Web](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWeb). Requests go over HTTP where GET requests should be used when data is fetched from the Tribler core and POST requests should be used if data in the core is manipulated (such as adding a torrent or removing a download). Responses of the requests are in JSON format.

Some requests require one or more parameters. These parameters are passed using the JSON format. An example of performing a request with parameters using the curl command line tool can be found below:

```
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8085/mychannel/rssfeeds/http%3A%2F%2Frssfeed.com%2Frss.xml
```

## Error handling

If an unhandled exception occurs the response will have code HTTP 500 and look like this:
```json
{
    "error": {
        "handled": False,
        "code": "SomeException",
        "message": "Human readable error message"
    }
}
```
If a valid request of a client caused a recoverable error the response will have code HTTP 500 and look like this:
```json
{
    "error": {
        "handled": True,
        "code": "DuplicateChannelNameError",
        "message": "Channel name already exists: foo"
    }
}
```

## Download states
There are various download states possible which are returned when fetching downloads. These states are explained in the table below.

| State | Description |
| ---- | --------------- |
| DLSTATUS_ALLOCATING_DISKSPACE | Libtorrent is allocating disk space for the download |
| DLSTATUS_WAITING4HASHCHECK | The download is waiting for the hash check to be performed |
| DLSTATUS_HASHCHECKING | Libtorrent is checking the hashes of the download |
| DLSTATUS_DOWNLOADING | The torrent is being downloaded |
| DLSTATUS_SEEDING | The torrent has been downloaded and is now being seeded to other peers |
| DLSTATUS_STOPPED | The torrent has stopped downloading, either because the downloading has completed or the user has stopped the download |
| DLSTATUS_STOPPED_ON_ERROR | The torrent has stopped because an error occurred |
| DLSTATUS_METADATA | The torrent information is being fetched from the DHT |
| DLSTATUS_CIRCUITS | The (anonymous) download is building circuits |

Open the event connection. Important events in Tribler are returned over the events endpoint.
This connection is held open. Each event is pushed over this endpoint in the form of a JSON dictionary.
Each JSON dictionary contains a type field that indicates the type of the event. No parameters are required.
If the events connection is not open and Tribler generates events, they will be buffered until the events connections
opens.

Currently, the following events are implemented:
- events_start: An indication that the event socket is opened and that the server is ready to push events.
