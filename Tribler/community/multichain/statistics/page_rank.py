    Class to compute page ranks according to a graph.

    Incremental PageRank is an approximation for the actual PageRank score. It is computed using
    a Monte Carlo method whereby random walks are performed across the graph. All these random
    walks are then stored in nested lists after which the number of occurrences of every node are
    counted. More random walks give a more precise approximation of the actual PageRank score.

    We choose R to be the number of random walks performed starting from every node. The stopping
    probability is c.

    In order to avoid updating (which is expensive) too often, the update_walk and count method
    have to be called manually before retrieving the computed ranks with the get_ranks method.
