    # VSIDS-based votes ratings
    # We use VSIDS since it provides an efficient way to add temporal decay to the voting system.
    # Temporal decay is necessary for two reasons:
    # 1. We do not gossip _unsubscription_ events, but we want votes decline for channels that go out of favor
    # 2. We want to promote the fresh content
    #
    # There are two differences with the classic VSIDS:
    # a. We scale the bump amount with passage of time, instead of on each bump event.
    #    By default, the bump amount scales 2.71 per 23hrs. Note though, that we only count Tribler uptime
    #    for this purpose. This is intentional, so the ratings do not suddenly drop after the user skips a week
    #    of uptime.
    # b. Repeated votes by some peer to some channel _do not add up_. Instead, the vote is refreshed by substracting
    #    the old amount from the current vote (it is stored in the DB), and adding the new one (1.0 votes, scaled). This
    #    is the reason why we have to keep the old votes in the DB, and normalize the old votes last_amount values - to
    #    keep them in the same "normalization space" to be compatible with the current votes values.

    # This binding is used to store normalization data and stats for VSIDS
