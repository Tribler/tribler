    Important events in Tribler are returned over the events endpoint. This connection is held open. Each event is
    pushed over this endpoint in the form of a JSON dictionary. Each JSON dictionary contains a type field that
    indicates the type of the event. Individual events are separated by a newline character (\n).

    Currently, the following events are implemented:

    - events_start: An indication that the event socket is opened and that the server is ready to push events.
    - search_result_channel: This event dictionary contains a search result with a channel that has been found.
    - search_result_torrent: This event dictionary contains a search result with a torrent that has been found.
    - upgrader_started: An indication that the Tribler upgrader has started.
    - upgrader_finished: An indication that the Tribler upgrader has finished.
    - upgrader_tick: An indication that the state of the upgrader has changed. The dictionary contains a human-readable
      string with the new state.
    - watch_folder_corrupt_torrent: This event is emitted when a corrupt .torrent file in the watch folder is found.
      The dictionary contains the name of the corrupt torrent file.
    - new_version_available: This event is emitted when a new version of Tribler is available.
    - tribler_started: An indicator that Tribler has completed the startup procedure and is ready to use.
    - channel_discovered: An indicator that Tribler has discovered a new channel. The event contains the name,
      description and dispersy community id of the discovered channel.
    - torrent_discovered: An indicator that Tribler has discovered a new torrent. The event contains the name and the
      dispersy community id of the discovered torrent.
