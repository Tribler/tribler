    This class runs a python console in the main thread, and starts
    a given Object in a second thread.

    The Object is assumed to implement at least two methods, run() and stop().
    - The run() method is the entry point for the thread.
    - The stop() method is used by the main thread to request that the
    object thread does a controlled shutdown and returns from the run method.
    If the worker thread does not return from run() within 2 seconds after stop()
    has been invoked, the console terminates the object thread more aggressively.

    AttributeNames of Object listed in the provided namespace will be
    included in the console namespace.
