A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

------------------- BitTorrent (for khashmir code) ---------------------------

BitTorrent Open Source License

Version 1.1

This BitTorrent Open Source License (the "License") applies to the 
BitTorrent client and related software products as well as any updates 
or maintenance releases of that software ("BitTorrent Products") that 
are distributed by BitTorrent, Inc. ("Licensor").  Any BitTorrent 
Product licensed pursuant to this License is a Licensed Product. 
Licensed Product, in its entirety, is protected by U.S. copyright law.  
This License identifies the terms under which you may use, copy, 
distribute or modify Licensed Product. 

Preamble

This Preamble is intended to describe, in plain English, the nature and 
scope of this License.  However, this Preamble is not a part of this 
license.  The legal effect of this License is dependent only upon the 
terms of the License and not this Preamble.

This License complies with the Open Source Definition and is derived 
from the Jabber Open Source License 1.0 (the "JOSL"), which has been 
approved by Open Source Initiative. Sections 4(c) and 4(f)(iii) from 
the JOSL have been deleted.

This License provides that:

1. You may use or give away the Licensed Product, alone or as a 
component of an aggregate software distribution containing programs 
from several different sources.  No royalty or other fee is required.

2. Both Source Code and executable versions of the Licensed Product, 
including Modifications made by previous Contributors, are available 
for your use.  (The terms "Licensed Product," "Modifications," 
"Contributors" and "Source Code" are defined in the License.)

3. You are allowed to make Modifications to the Licensed Product, and 
you can create Derivative Works from it. (The term "Derivative Works" 
is defined in the License.)

4.  By accepting the Licensed Product under the provisions of this 
License, you agree that any Modifications you make to the Licensed 
Product and then distribute are governed by the provisions of this 
License.  In particular, you must make the Source Code of your 
Modifications available to others free of charge and without a royalty.

5.  You may sell, accept donations or otherwise receive compensation 
for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without paying a royalty 
or other fee to the Licensor or any Contributor, provided that such 
executable versions contain your or another Contributor?s material 
Modifications. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your 
executable version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or 
another Contributor?s material Modifications, you may not sell, accept 
donations or otherwise receive compensation for such executable.

You may use the Licensed Product for any purpose, but the Licensor is 
not providing you any warranty whatsoever, nor is the Licensor 
accepting any liability in the event that the Licensed Product doesn't 
work properly or causes you any injury or damages.

6.      If you sublicense the Licensed Product or Derivative Works, you 
may charge fees for warranty or support, or for accepting indemnity or 
liability obligations to your customers.  You cannot charge for, sell, 
accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code.

7.      If you assert any patent claims against the Licensor relating 
to the Licensed Product, or if you breach any terms of the License, 
your rights to the Licensed Product under this License automatically 
terminate.

You may use this License to distribute your own Derivative Works, in 
which case the provisions of this License will apply to your Derivative 
Works just as they do to the original Licensed Product.

Alternatively, you may distribute your Derivative Works under any other 
OSI-approved Open Source license, or under a proprietary license of 
your choice.  If you use any license other than this License, however, 
you must continue to fulfill the requirements of this License 
(including the provisions relating to publishing the Source Code) for 
those portions of your Derivative Works that consist of the Licensed 
Product, including the files containing Modifications.

New versions of this License may be published from time to time in 
connection with new versions of a Licensed Product or otherwise.  You 
may choose to continue to use the license terms in this version of the 
License for the Licensed Product that was originally licensed 
hereunder, however, the new versions of this License will at all times 
apply to new versions of the Licensed Product released by Licensor 
after the release of the new version of this License.  Only the 
Licensor has the right to change the License terms as they apply to the 
Licensed Product. 

This License relies on precise definitions for certain terms.  Those 
terms are defined when they are first used, and the definitions are 
repeated for your convenience in a Glossary at the end of the License.

License Terms

1.      Grant of License From Licensor.  Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants you a world-wide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject to third party 
intellectual property claims, to do the following:

a.       Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and 
distribute any Modifications created by a Contributor or portions 
thereof, in both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an 
unmodified basis or as part of Derivative Works.

b.       Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled 
by Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or 
otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to 
the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, 
sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of 
Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof.

2. Grant of License to Modifications From Contributor. "Modifications" 
means any additions to or deletions from the substance or structure of 
(i) a file containing a Licensed Product, or (ii) any new file that 
contains any part of a Licensed Product. Hereinafter in this License, 
the term "Licensed Product" shall include all previous Modifications 
that you receive from any Contributor.  Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this License, By application of the provisions in Section 
4(a) below, each person or entity who created or contributed to the 
creation of, and distributed, a Modification (a "Contributor") hereby 
grants you a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license, subject 
to third party intellectual property claims, to do the following:

a. Use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute 
any Modifications created by such Contributor or portions thereof, in 
both Source Code or as an executable program, either on an unmodified 
basis or as part of Derivative Works.

b. Under claims of patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by 
Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or 
otherwise dispose of Modifications or portions thereof, but solely to 
the extent that any such claim is necessary to enable you to make, use, 
sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of 
Modifications or portions thereof or Derivative Works thereof. 

3.      Exclusions From License Grant.  Nothing in this License shall 
be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade 
secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor or any 
Contributor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is 
granted separate from the Licensed Product, for code that you delete 
from the Licensed Product, or for combinations of the Licensed Product 
with other software or hardware.  No right is granted to the trademarks 
of Licensor or any Contributor even if such marks are included in the 
Licensed Product. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to 
prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this 
License any code that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 
 As an express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you 
hereby agree that you will not, without the prior written consent of 
Licensor, use any trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any 
other intellectual property of Licensor or any Contributor except as 
expressly stated herein.  For the avoidance of doubt and without 
limiting the foregoing, you hereby agree that you will not use or 
display any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor in any domain 
name, directory filepath, advertisement, link or other reference to you 
in any manner or in any media.

4.      Your Obligations Regarding Distribution. 

a.       Application of This License to Your Modifications.  As an 
express condition for your use of the Licensed Product, you hereby 
agree that any Modifications that you create or to which you 
contribute, and which you distribute, are governed by the terms of this 
License including, without limitation, Section 2.  Any Modifications 
that you create or to which you contribute may be distributed only 
under the terms of this License or a future version of this License 
released under Section 7.  You must include a copy of this License with 
every copy of the Modifications you distribute.  You agree not to offer 
or impose any terms on any Source Code or executable version of the 
Licensed Product or Modifications that alter or restrict the applicable 
version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, 
you may include an additional document offering the additional rights 
described in Section 4(d).

b.       Availability of Source Code.  You must make available, without 
charge, under the terms of this License, the Source Code of the 
Licensed Product and any Modifications that you distribute, either on 
the same media as you distribute any executable or other form of the 
Licensed Product, or via a mechanism generally accepted in the software 
development community for the electronic transfer of data (an 
"Electronic Distribution Mechanism").  The Source Code for any version 
of Licensed Product or Modifications that you distribute must remain 
available for as long as any executable or other form of the Licensed 
Product is distributed by you.  You are responsible for ensuring that 
the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic 
Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.

c.       Intellectual Property Matters.  

                                i.            Third Party Claims.  If 
you have knowledge that a license to a third party's intellectual 
property right is required to exercise the rights granted by this 
License, you must include a text file with the Source Code distribution 
titled "LEGAL" that describes the claim and the party making the claim 
in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.  If 
you obtain such knowledge after you make any Modifications available as 
described in Section 4(b), you shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in 
all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps 
(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably 
calculated to inform those who received the Licensed Product from you 
that new knowledge has been obtained.

                               ii.            Contributor APIs.  If 
your Modifications include an application programming interface ("API") 
and you have knowledge of patent licenses that are reasonably necessary 
to implement that API, you must also include this information in the 
LEGAL file.

                              iii.            Representations.  You 
represent that, except as disclosed pursuant to 4(c)(i) above, you 
believe that any Modifications you distribute are your original 
creations and that you have sufficient rights to grant the rights 
conveyed by this License.

d.       Required Notices.  You must duplicate this License in any 
documentation you provide along with the Source Code of any 
Modifications you create or to which you contribute, and which you 
distribute, wherever you describe recipients' rights relating to 
Licensed Product.  You must duplicate the notice contained in Exhibit A 
(the "Notice") in each file of the Source Code of any copy you 
distribute of the Licensed Product. If you created a Modification, you 
may add your name as a Contributor to the Notice.  If it is not 
possible to put the Notice in a particular Source Code file due to its 
structure, then you must include such Notice in a location (such as a 
relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such 
a notice.  You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients 
of Licensed Product. However, you may do so only on your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Licensor or any Contributor.  You must make it 
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify 
the Licensor and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the 
Licensor or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms you offer.

e.        Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute 
Licensed Product as an executable program under a license of your 
choice that may contain terms different from this License provided (i) 
you have satisfied the requirements of Sections 4(a) through 4(d) for 
that distribution, (ii) you include a conspicuous notice in the 
executable version, related documentation and collateral materials 
stating that the Source Code version of the
Licensed Product is available under the terms of this License, 
including a description of how and where you have fulfilled the 
obligations of Section 4(b), and (iii) you make it clear that any terms 
that differ from this License are offered by you alone, not by Licensor 
or any Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the Licensor and 
every Contributor for any liability incurred by Licensor or such 
Contributor as a result of any terms you offer. 

f.       Distribution of Derivative Works.  You may create Derivative 
Works (e.g., combinations of some or all of the Licensed Product with 
other code) and distribute the Derivative Works as products under any 
other license you select, with the proviso that the requirements of 
this License are fulfilled for those portions of the Derivative Works 
that consist of the Licensed Product or any Modifications thereto.

g.	Compensation for Distribution of Executable Versions of 
Licensed Products, Modifications or Derivative Works.  Notwithstanding 
any provision of this License to the contrary, by distributing, 
selling, licensing, sublicensing or otherwise making available any 
Licensed Product, or Modification or Derivative Work thereof, you and 
Licensor hereby acknowledge and agree that you may sell, license or 
sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive 
compensation for executable versions of a Licensed Product, without 
paying a royalty or other fee to the Licensor or any other Contributor, 
provided that such executable versions (i) contain your or another 
Contributor?s material Modifications, or (ii) are otherwise material 
Derivative Works.  For purposes of this License, an executable version 
of the Licensed Product will be deemed to contain a material 
Modification, or will otherwise be deemed a material Derivative Work, 
if (a) the Licensed Product is modified with your own or a third 
party?s software programs or other code, and/or the Licensed Product is 
combined with a number of your own or a third party?s software programs 
or code, respectively, and (b) such software programs or code add or 
contribute material value, functionality or features to the License 
Product.  For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent your executable 
version of a Licensed Product does not contain your or another 
Contributor?s material Modifications or is otherwise not a material 
Derivative Work, in each case as contemplated herein, you may not sell, 
license or sublicense for a fee, accept donations or otherwise receive 
compensation for such executable.  Additionally, without limitation of 
the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision of this License to the 
contrary, you cannot charge for, sell, license or sublicense for a fee, 
accept donations or otherwise receive compensation for the Source Code. 

5.      Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.  If it is 
impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this License with 
respect to some or all of the Licensed Product due to statute, judicial 
order, or regulation, then you must (i) comply with the terms of this 
License to the maximum extent possible, (ii) cite the statute or 
regulation that prohibits you from adhering to the License, and (iii) 
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description 
must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 4(d), and must 
be included with all distributions of the Source Code.  Except to the 
extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be 
sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill at computer 
programming to be able to understand it. 

6.      Application of This License.  This License applies to code to 
which Licensor or Contributor has attached the Notice in Exhibit A, 
which is incorporated herein by this reference.

7.      Versions of This License.

a.       New Versions.  Licensor may publish from time to time revised 
and/or new versions of the License. 

b.       Effect of New Versions.  Once Licensed Product has been 
published under a particular version of the License, you may always 
continue to use it under the terms of that version, provided that any 
such license be in full force and effect at the time, and has not been 
revoked or otherwise terminated.  You may also choose to use such 
Licensed Product under the terms of any subsequent version (but not any 
prior version) of the License published by Licensor.  No one other than 
Licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to Licensed 
Product created under this License.

c.       Derivative Works of this License.  If you create or use a 
modified version of this License, which you may do only in order to 
apply it to software that is not already a Licensed Product under this 
License, you must rename your license so that it is not confusingly 
similar to this License, and must make it clear that your license 
contains terms that differ from this License.  In so naming your 
license, you may not use any trademark of Licensor or any Contributor.

8.      Disclaimer of Warranty.  LICENSED PRODUCT IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER 
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE 
LICENSED PRODUCT IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND 
PERFORMANCE OF THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD LICENSED 
PRODUCT PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (AND NOT THE LICENSOR OR 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS
DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. 
NO USE OF LICENSED PRODUCT IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS 
DISCLAIMER.

9.      Termination. 

a.       Automatic Termination Upon Breach.  This license and the 
rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to 
comply with the terms herein and fail to cure such breach within ten 
(10) days of being notified of the breach by the Licensor.  For 
purposes of this provision, proof of delivery via email to the address 
listed in the ?WHOIS? database of the registrar for any website through 
which you distribute or market any Licensed Product, or to any 
alternate email address which you designate in writing to the Licensor, 
shall constitute sufficient notification. All sublicenses to the 
Licensed Product that are properly granted shall survive any 
termination of this license so long as they continue to complye with 
the terms of this License.  Provisions that, by their nature, must 
remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.

b.       Termination Upon Assertion of Patent Infringement.  If you 
initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Licensor or a Contributor 
(Licensor or Contributor against whom you file such an action is 
referred to herein as Respondent) alleging that Licensed Product 
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
granted by such Respondent to you under Sections 1 or 2 of this License 
shall terminate prospectively upon sixty (60) days notice from 
Respondent (the "Notice Period") unless within that Notice Period you 
either agree in writing (i) to pay Respondent a mutually agreeable 
reasonably royalty for your past or future use of Licensed Product made 
by such Respondent, or (ii) withdraw your litigation claim with respect 
to Licensed Product against such Respondent.  If within said Notice 
Period a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually 
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not 
withdrawn, the rights granted by Licensor to you under Sections 1 and 2 
automatically terminate at the expiration of said Notice Period.

c.       Reasonable Value of This License.  If you assert a patent 
infringement claim against Respondent alleging that Licensed Product 
directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is 
resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of 
patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the 
licenses granted by said Respondent under Sections 1 and 2 shall be 
taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or 
license.

d.       No Retroactive Effect of Termination.  In the event of 
termination under Sections 9(a) or 9(b) above, all end user license 
agreements (excluding licenses to distributors and resellers) that have 
been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder prior to 
termination shall survive termination.

10.  Limitation of Liability.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO 
LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR 
OTHERWISE, SHALL THE LICENSOR, ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF 
LICENSED PRODUCT, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO 
ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR 
LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR 
ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY 
SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS 
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR 
PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT 
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT 
ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

11.  Responsibility for Claims.  As between Licensor and Contributors, 
each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or 
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.  You 
agree to work with Licensor and Contributors to distribute such 
responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing herein is intended or 
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

12.  U.S. Government End Users.  The Licensed Product is a commercial 
item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), 
consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer 
software documentation, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 
227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End 
Users acquire Licensed Product with only those rights set forth herein.

13.  Miscellaneous.  This License represents the complete agreement 
concerning the subject matter hereof.  If any provision of this License 
is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to 
the extent necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be 
governed by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law 
provisions.  You expressly agree that in any litigation relating to 
this license the losing party shall be responsible for costs including, 
without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and 
expenses.  The application of the United Nations Convention on 
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.  
Any law or regulation that provides that the language of a contract 
shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

14.  Definition of You in This License. You throughout this License, 
whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity 
exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this 
License or a future version of this License issued under Section 7.  
For legal entities, you includes any entity that controls, is 
controlled by, is under common control with, or affiliated with, you.  
For purposes of this definition, control means (i) the power, direct or 
indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether 
by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or 
more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such 
entity.  You are responsible for advising any affiliated entity of the 
terms of this License, and that any rights or privileges derived from 
or obtained by way of this License are subject to the restrictions 
outlined herein.

15.  Glossary.  All defined terms in this License that are used in more

		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!
